	<h3>Funny Story </h3>
	<p>When I was attending my dutch lessons. Some of lessons were online and some of them were offline. Generally every tuesday and thursday I have to attend them offline. One week before the exam my teacher told us to attend the lesson online and prepare. But I forgot and went to school for attending lessons so I was at school and everyone was attending it from home.	I missed that lesson.</p>
	<h4>A good lesson of life that not to forget the instructions.</h4>
